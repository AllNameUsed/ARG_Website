    <p>
        In yet another entirely unsurprising development, some bad people did some bad things that made the lives of other people noticeably worse.
    </p>

    <p>
        These actions, widely condemned by people who don’t hold any real power, resulted in a significant transfer of wealth, comfort, and general life satisfaction away from the many and into the grasp of the very few. The perpetrators, as usual, have issued statements that technically resemble apologies but are mostly just collections of words arranged to sound regretful.
    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, a handful of good people did good things—quietly, humbly, and usually at great personal cost. Their contributions, while deeply impactful on a small scale, were largely ignored by the public, received no media attention, and were algorithmically buried beneath trending topics such as “toaster breaks bagel in half” and “dog kind of looks like celebrity.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Government officials responded to everything with a carefully curated blend of concern, inaction, and vague commitments to address the matter in the distant future, possibly through a committee, maybe.
    </p>

    <p>
        In conclusion: the world continues to spin, powered mostly by despair, distraction, and a few resilient individuals yelling into the void.
    </p>

    <p>
        More updates as things continue to happen.

            Take care of yourself. Do something quiet and beautiful. Spend some quality time with maths, speaking of, can I interest you in a personal maths tutor that is also free of charge?
