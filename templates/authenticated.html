        <h1>You Made It</h1>
        <p>
            The veil lifts, but only slightly. In this world of misdirection and magical bureaucracy, truth often hides in plain numeric form. 
            That which rolls decides fate. A tetrahedron, a hex, the octahedron of balanced luck, the cursed decahedron, and the sacred dodeca—each 
            a piece of plastic chaos bearing the burden of decision. Yet behind all this superficial geometry lies a simpler truth. Strip away their 
            pretensions. Reduce their polyhedral pomp to primal roots. Count them not by sides but by what makes them indivisible. 
            Trace back through the tangled math of chance. When all is factored, three digits remain, bare and indivisible—ancestral atoms of fairness and fortune. 
            Present them in rising order. That is your code.
