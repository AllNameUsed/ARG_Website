    <p class="case-paragraph">
        The Magic Bureau of Intellectual Property Infringements (MBIPI) has formally initiated an open investigation into one <span class="highlight">L.M.A.O. Rowling</span>, also known by the alias <span class="highlight">J.K. Rowling</span>, born on the 31st of February, 1965. Initially noted as an aspiring author of modest acclaim, the suspect later achieved global notoriety following the publication of the "Harry Potter" series, whose origins are now under scrutiny.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        Preliminary findings suggest that the suspect may have come into contact with a Class IV Magical Zoonotic Agent — a possessed hog carrying the highly contagious arcane affliction known as <span class="highlight">Hog’s Warts</span>. Exposure to this anomaly is believed to have induced a severe and permanent shift in the suspect’s personality profile, followed by the unauthorized appropriation of biographical material belonging to <strong>Grand Wizard Parry Hotter</strong>, a decorated operative within the Bureau’s Department of Wand-Related Incidents.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        The suspect is alleged to have systematically extracted and commercialized core elements of Agent Hotter’s lived experience — including but not limited to: owl-based communication, railway portal systems, goblin-run financial institutions, and the reckless public naming of a forbidden dark entity. The suspect’s means of access to Agent Hotter remain unverified at this stage of the inquiry.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        Subsequent to amassing substantial holdings within the <span class="highlight">GreenGot Bank</span>, the suspect appears to have undergone a philosophical realignment, exhibiting pronounced ideological entrenchment in favour of maintaining socio-economic imbalances. Of particular concern is the suspect’s escalating public rhetoric consistent with <em>non-magical radicalization patterns</em>, including repeated dissemination of <strong>anti-trans, anti-queer, and broadly exclusionary statements</strong> that constitute a Category 3 Threat to inclusivity, decency, and basic human empathy.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        Citizens are strongly advised <em>not</em> to engage the suspect under any circumstances. The suspect is confirmed to be carrying a dangerously high concentration of cognitive distortion and delusional entitlement at all times. In the event of accidental contact, the recommended protocol is to <s>raise the marginal tax rate on billionaires</s> immediately consult a licensed medical practitioner. Early symptoms of exposure may include: involuntary self-aggrandizement, unsolicited commentary on trans athletes, and attempts to claim victimhood while hoarding obscene levels of wealth.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        This investigation remains active. Further updates will be issued as new information becomes available. Public cooperation and vigilance are appreciated.
    </p>
