    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/most-wanted.jpg') }}" alt="Mug Shot of Suspect" class="mugshot">

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        The Magic Bureau of Intellectual Property Infringements (MBIPI) has opened a formal investigation into the
        actions of demonic author <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong>, who stands accused of extensive magical plagiarism.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        The suspect is believed to have extracted — without consent — the biographical details, adventures, and magical
        experiences of <strong>Senior Agent Parry Hotter</strong>, currently serving with distinction in the Bureau’s
        Department of Wand-Related Incidents. Multiple parallels between Agent Hotter’s documented life and the so-called
        “Harry Potter” book series have been identified, including but not limited to: owls, platform-based teleportation,
        troll altercations, and the illegal naming of a powerful dark wizard.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        In addition to unauthorised narrative extraction, the suspect has also demonstrated a consistent pattern of
        increasingly public alignment with <em>non-magical extremist ideologies</em>, raising significant concern about
        her ongoing influence over impressionable muggle populations.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        A formal cease-and-desist scroll has been dispatched via phoenix courier. The suspect remains under watch and has
        been added to the MBIPI’s <strong>Most Wanted for Narrative Theft and Bigotry Watchlist</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="case-paragraph">
        Citizens are advised not to engage the suspect in discourse, especially online. All sightings should be reported
        to your nearest magical authority or directly via enchanted parchment.
    </p>
